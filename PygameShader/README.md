# Pygame Shaders Library 


*New Version 1.0.10


```
pip install PygameShader==1.0.10
```

Some scripts have been ported to GPU using CUPY and CUDA raw Kernels for running 
on NVIDIA graphics cards (NVIDIA CUDA GPU with the compute Capability 3.0 or larger.). 
These shaders are only compatible with NVIDIA chipset.

In order to use the GPU shaders the library `CUPY` has to be 
installed on your system in addition to CUDA Toolkit: 
v10.2 / v11.0 / v11.1 / v11.2 / v11.3 / v11.4 / v11.5 / v11.6. 
Please refer to the below link for the full installation 
https://docs.cupy.dev/en/stable/install.html

The GPU shaders are still experimental, and the performances are restricted
by the pci-express bandwidth due to the amount of data sent from the CPU to 
the GPU, especially when the shaders are use for real time rendering.

Check the Shader GPU_demo_ripple.py in the `Demo folder` for an example of real time 
rendering of a pygame.Surface.

How this shaders compare to GLSL (GL shading language): 
You may ask yourself how fast these shaders perform against the shading language GLSL,
well without any doubt GLSL outperform CUPY & CUDA for graphics performance. 
However, CUDA is taking advantage of its highly parallelized architecture and will improve 
the speed of pygame, python & cython algorithms designed for CPU architecture only.

Difference between shading language and CUDA:
CUDA is essentially just a way to run compute shaders without the graphics API and
without requiring a particular language. CUDA programs are compiled into PTX (NVIDIA's
analoque to x86 assembly for the GPU.

*In python*
```
from PygameShader.shader_gpu import *

Pygame shader project is a `2D game library` written in Python and Cython containing
`special effects` for development of multimedia applications like video games, arcade game, 
video and camera image processing or to customize your sprites textures/surfaces.

This library is compatible with BMP, GIF (non - animated), JPEG, PNG image format.
```
pygame may not always be built to support all image formats. At minimum it will support 
uncompressed BMP. If pygame.image.get_extended() returns 'True', you should be able to
load most images (including PNG, JPG and GIF).
```

The shaders can be applied to the `entire game display` for a real time rendering @ 60 fps
for games running in medium resolution such as `1024 x 768`. 
Some algorithms are more demanding than others in terms of processing power 
ex : median filtering and predator vision (due to the fact that it is built with more
than one shader to provide a composite effect). Consequently, not all shader will run at
the same speed at medium resolutions. Feel free to experiment with higher display resolutions
while the shader provides 60 fps or above.

If you are using the shader library for sprites texturing and special effects
then the overall processing time should be extremely fast due to code optimization with
cython. Nevertheless, to keep a good frame rate, it is advised to keep the sprites below
the screen display resolution e,g 200x200 texture size.

PygameShader provide tools to improve your overall game appearance by changing 
Sprites texture/surface and or by using great special effects that will affect 
the entire screen.

## Demo

In the PygameShader `Demo` directory 

(press ESC to quit the demo)

```bash
C:\>python demo_fire.py
C:\>python demo_transition.py
C:\>python demo_wave.py
```
*if cupy and CUDA are installed correctly on your system you can run the GPU shaders*
```bash
C:\>python gpu_chromatic.py
C:\>python gpu_zoom.py
C:\>python gpu_wave.py

```

## Building Cython & C code 

#### When do you need to compile the cython code ? 

Each time you are modifying any of the pyx files such as 
shader.pyx, shader.pxd, __init__.pxd or any external C code if applicable

1) open a terminal window
2) Go in the main project directory where (shader.pyx & 
   shader.pxd files are located)
3) run : `C:\>python setup_shader.py build_ext --inplace --force`

If you have to compile the code with a specific python 
version, make sure to reference the right python version 
in (`python38 setup_shader.py build_ext --inplace`)

If the compilation fail, refers to the requirement section and 
make sure Cython and a C-compiler are correctly install on your
 system.
- A compiler such visual studio, MSVC, CGYWIN setup correctly on 
  your system.
  - a C compiler for windows (Visual Studio, MinGW etc) install 
  on your system and linked to your Windows environment.
  Note that some adjustment might be needed once a compiler is 
  install on your system, refer to external documentation or 
  tutorial in order to setup this process.e.g :
    
https://devblogs.microsoft.com/python/unable-to-find-vcvarsall-bat/

*Edit the file config.py and check the variable OPENMP.*
*You can enable or disable multi-processing*
```python
# Build the cython code with mutli-processing (OPENMP) 
OPENMP : bool = True
```
*Save the change and build the cython code with the following instruction:*
```bash
C:\PygameShader\PygameShader\python setup_shader.py build_ext --inplace --force
````
*If the project build successfully, the compilation will end up with the following lines*
```
Generating code
Finished generating code
```
If you have any compilation error(s) refer to the section ```Building cython code```, make sure 
your system has the following program & libraries installed. Check also that the code is not 
running in a different thread. 
- Python > 3.6
- numpy >= 1.18
- pygame >=2.4.0
- cython >=3.0.2
- setuptools~=54.1.1
- cupy >=9.6.0
- A C compiler for windows (Visual Studio, MinGW etc)
---
## OPENMP for Linux and Windows

The pip packages (including LINUX architectures i686 and x86_64), are build by default with multiprocessing for 
the CPU's shader. If you need to build the package without multiprocessing, you can change the flag OPENMP  
in the setup.py file such as :

To build the package without multiprocessing (OPENMP=False)


*in the config.py file*
```bash
# True enable the multiprocessing
OPENMP : bool = True
OPENMP_PROC : str = "-fopenmp" 
```
*Then compile the code (e.g : Version 1.0.8, 64-bit python3.7)*
```cmdline
C:\PygameShader\python setup.py bdist_wheel 
cd dist
pip install PygameShader-1.0.8-cp37-cp37m-win_amd64.whl
```

*The same variable `OPENMP` exist also in the setup_config.py file when building the Cython code*

* Building PygameShader package will automatically check and compile the source code, you do not 
need to build manually the Cython code.
